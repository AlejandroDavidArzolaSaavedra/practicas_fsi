<h1 align="center">Graph Nodes Romania Visualization 📊</h1>

This files, includes interactive bar charts representing the performance metrics of different search algorithms across various cities in Romania. The duration, expanded nodes, and visited nodes are visualized for each algorithm.

## How to Use:

### Local Execution:
1. 📥 Download the HTML file to your local machine.
2. 🌐 Open the file using a web browser.
3. 🚀 Explore the bar charts displaying algorithmic performance metrics for cities A, O, G, and N.

## Chart Details:

- 📊 The charts are divided into two categories: "Expanded Nodes" and "Visited Nodes."
- 🏙️ Each city (A, O, G, N) has its own set of charts representing different search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Branch_and_bound_Without, Branch_and_bound_With).

## Technologies Used:

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/): A JavaScript library for creating interactive and visually appealing charts.

## Customization:

Feel free to 🎨 customize the charts, colors, and data to suit your specific needs. You can also add more cities or algorithms to the `citiesData` object for an expanded visualization.

Enjoy exploring the algorithmic performance across the cities of Romania! 🌍
